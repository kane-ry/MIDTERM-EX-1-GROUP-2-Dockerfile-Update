Our group worked to complete this assignment by scheduling a meeting with all members. We reviewed the assignment and decided to debug the Dockerfile using Discord. First, we checked and updated the imports to their latest versions. When we ran the file, we encountered dependency issues. By reading the error messages, we identified specific version requirements for certain dependencies. We selected versions that satisfied all dependencies, addressing each error until none remained. We then reran the Dockerfile, retested Jupyter Notebook, restarted the kernel, and ran all the cells to ensure everything worked without errors. Finally, we submitted a pull request with the updated Dockerfile.
